# Player Feedback - Playtest #1
**Date**: 2024-12-14

## Summary
First playtest was successful - the core gameplay loop hooked the player. Interest in crafting new items was a highlight.

---

## What Worked ✅
- Core gameplay loop is solid
- Interest in making new items / crafting
- Spread Rumors task and gaining Influence feels good

---

## Pain Points & Issues 🔴

### Tactile Feedback (High Priority)
- [ ] Unclear when items get added to inventory
- [ ] Unclear when items get equipped to Hero
- [ ] Unclear when enough items are in inventory to work on the next task
- [ ] Not enough feedback when a task cannot be completed or is out of resources

### Task Discovery System
- [ ] Randomly rolling tasks is frustrating
  - **Consider**: Cycles or just unlocking the task directly

### Guild Hall Penalties
- [ ] Chance to lose items feels confusing and bad
  - **Keep**: Time penalty is fine
  - **Remove**: Item loss chance

### Explore/Area System
- [ ] Explore → Area cycle is confusing
  - Needs clearer explanation or simplification

### Retirement System
- [ ] Retire mechanic may not be understood
- [ ] May not feel satisfying

### Complexity Issues
- [ ] Rarity system may be too confusing
- [ ] Crafting up (trade-up) system may be too confusing

### UI/UX
- [ ] Learning the UI was challenging
- [ ] Information overload - too much at once

## Deferred
- Bug fixes (lower priority for now, lots to build first)
