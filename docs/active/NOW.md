# NOW — start here

*Updated 2026-10-08. Update this page at the end of every session. Keep it
under one screen: what's next first, finished work gone (it lives in git, the
changelog and `docs/archive/`).*

## Next

1. **Owner CMS to-do for brief 20** (the engine is merged; the live-game
   done-when waits on this content):
   1. Open the CMS once, check the trees read **Forestry**, and **Sync to
      Game with `main` checked out** (the sync commits `data/` onto the current
      branch). Then T-114 removes the temporary Logging→Forestry bridge.
   2. Author the **Wizard Academy** build recipe and the **Ranger** and
      **Rogue Academy** Tokens (art exists: `token_school_ranger` / `_rogue`;
      register the sprites), each with a Promotes rule and a Wood or Stone
      Foundation build recipe (minimum tier per brief 10 U5). Promotion is
      free unless you price it.
   3. **Eight master-class Tokens**, one per master class (Paladin, Knight,
      Beastmaster, Hunter, Necromancer, Scholar, Merchant, Assassin), built on
      Foundations like the Academies.
   4. Still open from brief 10: Foundation **Tier** on each Foundation, Shop
      group labels, minimum Foundation tier on building recipes, higher anvils'
      "Acts as: anvil, tool tier N".
2. **Brief 30, hero bar and panel** ([brief](briefs/30_hero_bar_panel.md)) on
   the new 25-skill list. Read the "Hero bar and panels" notes in
   [design_pass_notes.md](design_pass_notes.md) first; T-115 (Logging wording in
   the tutorial and ceremony) fits its eye-check.
3. **Brief 20 live-game check** once items 1.1–1.3 exist: a Recruit promotes
   to each basic class through its Academy and on to a master class.
4. **T-111**: engine bench timings are load-sensitive; trust the work check,
   re-run timing verdicts alone before believing them.

**Director notes (2026-10-08):** brief 20's four slices ran as one engineer
(R1) then three parallel builders in worktrees (R2a, R2b, R3) on Opus; every
report was checked against the code and the running game before merging, and
all held. Another session commits the ideas inbox (`docs/active/ideas.md`)
straight onto `main`; expect its commits between yours.

## Where the project is

- **Version** 0.8.x on `main`. Crunch prep is done: GDD, tickets, measuring
  tools and baseline ([PERFORMANCE.md](../reference/PERFORMANCE.md)), design
  interviews, and the briefs.
- **Crunch order:** UI rework ✓ → class rework v2 ✓ (engine) → hero bar and panel →
  offline progress → drag deep-dive → deep optimization → Atlas → terrain →
  Performance Envelope ([briefs](briefs/README.md)).
- **Tests:** all green (4095 passed, 3 skipped). Anything red is new.

## Ground rules during the crunch

- **Measure, don't fix** anything drawn (brief 30 too): one line per phase in
  PERFORMANCE.md's "UI rework cost log"; optimization comes later (brief 60).
- **Don't add expensive effects** to the mat (background blur, layout-shifting
  animation, heavy transparency over animation) without logging their cost.
- **Don't invest in what the Atlas replaces**: the bin, and resource spawners
  in the Shop.

## Design docs in flight

- [ui_rework_list.md](ui_rework_list.md): locked UI decisions and the owner's list
  (brief 30 still uses its hero bar, panel and work-rules sections).
- [design_pass_notes.md](design_pass_notes.md): owner taste notes for later.
- [concept_skill_and_class_rework_v2.md](concept_skill_and_class_rework_v2.md):
  read its amendments first.
- [concept_offline_progress.md](concept_offline_progress.md).
- [concept_atlas.md](concept_atlas.md): read its owner decisions first. The
  unfinished Atlas code is parked on branch `atlas-wip`.
