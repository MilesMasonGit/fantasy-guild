# Code Review **Round 2** — Findings Tracker

Persistent tracker for the second full-codebase review. See
[`code_review_v2_guide.md`](code_review_v2_guide.md) for scope, objectives,
scoring, and the session plan. **Every review session writes into this file**;
fix waves later update ticket statuses here.

Round 1's tracker (`code_review_findings.md`, 53 tickets, to be archived) is
history. Only the leftovers carried forward by Prerequisite 4 appear here.

## Shared Inputs *(filled by the prerequisites, used by every session)*

### Baseline

- Branch / commit: `main` @ `edb2e2d` (cleanup merge), tree clean
- Test baseline: **875 passed / 21 skipped / 0 failed**, 59 files
- Build baseline: **912.23 KB JS** (279.76 KB gzip), **282.59 KB CSS** (44.25 KB
  gzip), single chunk, no warnings. Round 1 ended at 1,036 KB JS.
  ⚠ `public/assets` is **11 MB** — more than 10× the JS bundle and the real size
  lever for a Steam build (CR2-008).
- Source size: **260 files** in `src/`, down from 305.

### Reachability — files nothing imports *(Prereq 3)*

*Paste `node tools/reachability.mjs` output here. Caveat from the tool's own
header: the import regex also matches commented-out imports, so this list is a
floor, not a ceiling. Ignore `src/tests/` lines — vitest finds those itself.*

Re-run after the cleanup's deletions. Three non-test entries remain, all
accounted for — **treat this list as fully triaged, not as work**:

```
   165 src/config/registries/modifierPalette.js   <- LIVE, but only via cms/src (see below)
    86 src/config/registries/tokenConstants.js    <- LIVE via cms/src; also ContentRules.test.js
    83 src/systems/core/EventBatch.js             <- KEPT DELIBERATELY, see CR2-007
```

*(`StatProcessor.js` was on this list and was genuinely dead — deleted
2026-08-18 after checking both `src/` and `cms/`.)*

### ⚠ Three ways this tool lies — read before deleting anything it lists

1. **It walks from `src/main.jsx` only**, so files used solely by **tests**
   report as unreachable. Deleting on its word broke the suite once during the
   cleanup (`RecruitSystem`).
2. **It does not know the CMS exists.** `cms/src` imports seven modules directly
   out of the game's `src/` — see CR2-010. Two entries above are live *only*
   because of that. Nothing in the game reaches them, and no game test covers
   them, so deleting them looks safe right up until the CMS breaks. The CMS has
   no tests of its own (CR2-006), so nothing would catch it.
3. **Searching for a filename is not the same as finding an import.** An earlier
   pass here matched any quoted string containing the stem, including doc
   comments, and wrongly cleared all three files above as "live via
   triggerRegistry" — `triggerRegistry` imports none of them. Match on an actual
   `from '…'` specifier, then confirm the exported symbols are referenced.

The reliable check is: grep `src/`, grep `cms/src/`, grep `src/tests/`, and
check the exported symbols — not the filename — before removing anything.

## Ticket Format

```
### CR2-NNN · P0–P3 · S/M/L · Session N · Status: Open
- **Where**: src/path/File.js:123
- **What**: One-sentence statement of the defect or debt.
- **Why it matters**: Plain-language impact on the game or player.
- **Suggested fix**: Concrete direction (not a full diff — those are written
  by the fix session against current code).
- **Related**: CR2-XXX, a round-1 ticket, roadmap §, or concept doc reference.
- **Confidence**: Only if suspected-but-unproven; say what would confirm it.
```

Statuses: `Open` → `Fixed (date, commit)` / `Won't fix (reason)` /
`Superseded by CR2-XXX`. Fix sessions update this line; never delete tickets.

Out-of-territory observations: file a stub ticket (Where + What only) tagged
with the session that owns that territory, so it's waiting for them.

**Owner-decision tickets:** if a finding needs the owner to choose, say so in
the ticket and present the options as labelled multiple choice with a
recommendation — don't leave it as an open question.

---

## System Map *(each session fills in its territory)*

Goal: a holistic picture of how systems connect, built up across sessions.
For each system note: **state it owns** (paths in GameState), **events
published**, **events subscribed**, **who calls it / what it calls**. Flag
contract mismatches (publisher payload ≠ subscriber expectation) as tickets.

Round 1 built a map of a codebase that no longer exists — start fresh.

### Session 1 — State core

### Session 2 — Board engine
*(pending)*

### Session 3 — Combat, heroes, skills & promotion

## Findings

*(Tickets are appended below, grouped by session, as sessions run.)*

### Filed by the preliminary cleanup phase (2026-08-18)

These came out of the test triage, before Session 1. They are numbered in the
review's sequence so the fix waves can pick them up normally.

---

### CR2-001 · P2 · S · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: `data/tokens.json` → `token_copper_pickaxe` (and `token_forge_altar`)
- **What**: Authored Tokens carry an empty `theme` (`""`), which is not a value
  the game's vocabulary declares. `ContentRules` catches it as
  `token_copper_pickaxe has unknown theme ""`.
- **Why it matters**: Theme is the only thing that makes a Map's loot pool mean
  anything — the rule these Tokens break is the one stopping a Woodland Map from
  dropping desert content. A blank theme won't match any Map's pool filter, so
  the Token silently can't appear where it should.
- **Suggested fix**: Set a real theme in the CMS, not by hand in `data/` — a
  hand-edit is overwritten by the next Sync to Game. Worth checking whether the
  CMS lets a Token be saved with no theme at all; if so, that's the actual bug
  and this is its symptom.
- **Related**: CR2-005. Found by `ContentRules.test.js` "classifies every Token
  with vocabulary the game declares".

---

### CR2-002 · P2 · S · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: `data/tokens.json` → `token_copper_pickaxe.sprite`
- **What**: Points at `Token_pickaxe_copper.png`, which does not exist on disk.
- **Why it matters**: A Token with no art renders as a fallback wherever it
  appears — tray, board, vault. Visible to the player, and the kind of thing
  that's invisible in review until someone happens to obtain that Token.
- **Suggested fix**: Either the art needs generating, or the reference is a
  naming mismatch — note the id/sprite naming inversion this project has
  elsewhere (`oak_wood` → sprite `wood_oak`), so check the manifest for the
  same file under a transposed name before commissioning art.
- **Related**: CR2-001. Found by `ContentRules.test.js` "⚠️ points every Token
  at art that actually exists".

---

### CR2-003 · P1 · M · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: `src/tests/CMSBalanceEngine.test.js` (3 cases, now `it.skip`) →
  `cms/src/engine/anchorCalculator.js`, `valuePropagator.js`, `balanceRunner.js`
- **What**: Three balance-solver assertions each come out at half their expected
  value — `expected 1 to be close to 2`. The anchor calculator should resolve
  Oakwood Grove as primary anchor and derive Oak Wood at 2.0g; it derives 1.0g.
  The value propagator and the end-to-end runner fail consistently with that.
- **Why it matters**: This is the machinery that computes every price and yield
  in the game. If it's genuinely off by a factor of two, all authored content is
  balanced against wrong numbers, and the symptom is a game that plays badly
  rather than anything that crashes — the slowest possible bug to find.
- **Suggested fix**: **Confirm the cause before assuming a maths bug.** The
  favoured hypothesis is content, not code: the anchor token these tests name
  ("Oakwood Grove") may be the re-authored `token_oak_forest`, in which case the
  solver is anchoring on something absent and this is a stale test. Settle that
  first; only then look at the arithmetic.
- **Confidence**: Cause unproven. Confirmed by checking whether the anchor id
  the test expects still exists in `data/tokens.json`.
- **Related**: Scope note — `cms/src` internals are out of the review's scope,
  so this ticket covers the *boundary* symptom. The solver's own correctness is
  the standing gap in CR2-006.

---

### CR2-004 · P2 · M · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: `src/tests/fixtures/testTokens.js`, `src/config/registries/itemRegistry.js`
- **What**: Fixture insulation is now partial, not complete.
  `registerItems` (added in `8935468`) covers the 10 item ids current content
  doesn't define, but `item_oak_wood`, `item_charcoal` and `item_copper_ore` are
  deliberately left pointing at real content so `Market` and `RosterAndMarkets`
  keep measuring real values.
- **Why it matters**: Those three ids are still a tripwire. Re-authoring or
  renaming any of them breaks engine suites that aren't about them — exactly the
  coupling Phase 10's fixture split exists to prevent, and exactly what just
  cost ~25 test failures.
- **Suggested fix**: Give every fixture its own `fixture_*` item and update the
  assertions that name real ids across the six affected suites. Mechanical but
  wide; wasn't smuggled into the cleanup.
- **Related**: `8935468`.

---

### CR2-005 · P3 · S · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: `src/tests/ContentRules.test.js` (18 cases, now `it.skip`)
- **What**: The content-validation rules are skipped while content is
  mid-re-authoring (live set: 5 items, 10 Tokens). They describe a *complete*
  content set and can't pass against a partial one.
- **Why it matters**: These are the acceptance criteria for "content is finished
  enough to ship". Left skipped indefinitely, the project loses its only
  mechanical check that authored content is well-formed — and skipped tests tend
  to stay skipped.
- **Suggested fix**: Un-skip in step with content authoring rather than in one
  go. Session 9 should check this ticket before signing off on test coverage.
- **Related**: CR2-001, CR2-002 (real defects this suite caught).

---

### CR2-007 · P1 · M · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: `src/systems/core/EventBatch.js`; hook surface in
  `src/systems/core/EventBus.js:19,27`
- **What**: **Event coalescing is no longer wired to anything.** `EventBatch`
  collects events raised during a tick and de-duplicates them before they reach
  the UI. Round 1 verified its two callers — `LoopRunner.tick` and
  `StationManager.tick` — paired begin/flush correctly. Both were deleted by the
  playmat rework, and `BoardRunner` never took up the mechanism. Nothing in
  `src/` now calls `EventBatch.queue`, `begin` or `flush`; `EventBus` still
  carries the batch-capture hook for a batch that is never opened.
- **Why it matters**: This is objective 3's "events are coalesced so the UI
  can't render-storm". Without it, every state change during a tick publishes
  straight through to React. With a 7×7 board of running tiles this is exactly
  the shape that produces render storms — many small publishes per tick, each
  potentially re-rendering subscribers. It may currently be masked by the board
  being sparsely populated during testing.
- **Suggested fix**: **Deliberately not deleted**, though it is technically dead
  code — it is a working, previously-verified solution, and deleting it would
  make whoever fixes the render storm rebuild it. Decide whether `BoardRunner`
  should open a batch per tick the way `LoopRunner` did. Session 2 (board
  engine) and Session 8 (runtime verification) both need this on their list;
  Session 8 should measure render counts per tick before and after wiring it.
- **Confidence**: The wiring gap is confirmed by grep. Whether it currently
  causes a *measurable* problem is not — that needs Session 8's render census.
- **Related**: Round 1 objective 3; CR2-003 is unrelated.

---

### CR2-008 · P2 · M · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: `public/assets/` (11 MB), chiefly `audio/` 5.0 MB,
  `backgrounds/` 2.9 MB, `items/` 1.2 MB, `playmat/` 696 KB
- **What**: The shipped asset payload is **11 MB against a 912 KB JS bundle** —
  assets are more than ten times the code. Nobody has cross-checked them against
  what `sprite-manifest.js` and `AssetPreloader` actually reference since the
  playmat and CMS reworks changed what content exists.
- **Why it matters**: This is the real size lever for a Steam build; the code
  bundle is already small. Round 1 flagged one 3.8 MB BGM file and a set of
  retired-era backgrounds. The backgrounds in particular were authored for the
  old area-banner UI, which no longer exists — but the 7×7 playmat art *is*
  live now, so the round-1 verdict on `playmat/` is inverted and cannot be
  reused. Needs checking, not assuming.
- **Suggested fix**: Build the referenced-asset set from `sprite-manifest.js`,
  `AssetPreloader` and any literal `/assets/...` strings, diff it against the
  files on disk, and report the orphans by directory before deleting anything.
  Art is expensive to regenerate and cheap to keep, so this wants evidence
  rather than a sweep.
- **Deliberately not done in the cleanup**: it needs the manifest cross-check
  above, which is a session's work rather than a mechanical pass.
- **Related**: Session 9 (build & Tauri readiness) owns the bundle audit.

---

### CR2-009 · P3 · S · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: the repo root — 43 `.md` files after the cleanup archived 7
- **What**: The root still mixes live references with documents for finished
  work. The cleanup moved only those with an **explicit successor** (a v1 where
  a v2 exists, a brief where its roadmap exists). Everything else needs an
  owner ruling, because "is this still live?" is not answerable from the files.
- **Why it matters**: The review guide already warns that stale concept docs
  describing retired systems (the linear 12 areas, the hero bench, food/drink
  slots, packs as a shop) must not be treated as truth. The more of them sit
  beside the live roadmaps, the likelier a session reads the wrong one — and
  round 1 filed tickets against exactly that mistake.
- **Suggested fix**: Owner passes over the root list and marks each as live or
  finished. Likely-finished candidates, all pending confirmation: the playmat
  concept set (`playmat_grid_concept`, `playmat_hero_concept`,
  `playmat_skills_concept`, `playmat_ui_concept`, `playmat_gap_analysis`,
  `playmat_refinement_briefs`), the intent notes for shipped features
  (`bank_drawer_intent`, `token_object_intent`, `token_object_brief`,
  `tray_loose_objects_intent`), `status_effects_plan`, `ui_overhaul_spec`,
  and `Fantasy_Guild_Granular_Implementation_Plan`.
  **Do not archive on inference**: `playmat_balance_report_v1.md` holds the
  balance numbers and the solver plans may still be live work
  (`cms_solver_plan_v2`, `solver_levers_brief` — recent commits touch them).
- **Related**: `archive/docs/README.md`; Session 9 owns documentation health.

---

### CR2-010 · P2 · M · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: `cms/src/utils/constants.js`, `cms/src/**` → seven modules under
  the game's `src/`: `registries/modifierPalette.js`, `registries/itemRegistry.js`,
  `registries/skillRegistry.js`, `registries/tokenConstants.js`,
  `registries/triggerRegistry.js`, `registries/equipmentCategories.js`,
  `utils/AssetManager.js`
- **What**: The CMS reaches across the project boundary and imports game source
  directly, by relative path (`../../../src/config/registries/...`). The two
  codebases have separate `package.json` files and separate build pipelines, but
  are silently coupled at the module level.
- **Why it matters**: **Two of those modules have no game-side consumer at all** —
  `modifierPalette` (164 lines) and `tokenConstants` (85 lines) exist *solely*
  to serve the CMS. Nothing in the running game imports them and no game test
  covers them, so every dead-code tool reports them as removable. Delete one and
  the game keeps building, the game's tests stay green, and the CMS breaks — and
  since the CMS has no tests (CR2-006), nothing catches it. This nearly happened
  during the cleanup; the deletion was caught only because three CMS-adjacent
  suites happen to live in the game's test directory.
- **Suggested fix**: Owner decision on the shape. The options are to make the
  shared vocabulary an explicit shared module both sides import deliberately, to
  let the CMS own its own copy, or to leave the coupling and simply **document
  it loudly** at the top of each of the seven files so nobody deletes one. The
  last is cheapest and would have prevented this.
- **Related**: CR2-006 (no CMS tests). Note the round-2 scope decision puts
  `cms/src` internals out of review, but this is a boundary issue and in scope.

---

### CR2-006 · P2 · L · Cleanup phase · Status: Open
- **Where**: `cms/src/` (whole app)
- **What**: The CMS has **no tests of its own**. Its only coverage anywhere is
  three suites on the game side, of which the balance-engine one is currently
  skipped (CR2-003).
- **Why it matters**: The 13-module solver engine computes the game's balance
  numbers. An arithmetic error there produces content that looks fine and plays
  badly. Recorded here so the deliberate scope decision (2026-08-18: `cms/src`
  internals out of scope for round 2) doesn't quietly become permanent.
- **Suggested fix**: Owner decision — a dedicated CMS pass after round 2, or
  accept the risk explicitly.
- **Related**: Scope section of `code_review_v2_guide.md`; CR2-003.
